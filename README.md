# Friend Finder
## UW Bootcamp Week 13 Homework

Need some friends or maybe... a more than friend? We've got an app for that ;)

## Homework Instructions
In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You will use Express to handle routing.

## How to access it
This application is hosted in Heroku! The front-end experience can be found here: [INSERT]. If you'd like to see the action behind the scenes, check out the github repo: [https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/friendfinder.git](https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/friendfinder.git).
